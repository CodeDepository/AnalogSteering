# AnalogSteering
Python script which will map an analog joystick movement on mouse or graphics tablet and can use that movement in any video game, which normally we cannot.

BEFORE YOU RUN:
Step 1:
Download and install the latest ViGEmBus driver.

Step 2:
Install the following Python libraries using pip:
1. pyautogui
2. vgamepad

To install these libraries, run the following commands in your terminal:
pip install pyautogui
pip install vgamepad


ONCE ALL THE STEPS ARE COMPLETED YOU CAN RUN THE PYTHON FILE, AND IF IT DOESN'T GIVE AN ERROR AND WILL SAY: "Running analog steering script. Move your MOUSE OR PEN to steer."
